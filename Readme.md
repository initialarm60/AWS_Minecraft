Summary: Have an up-to-date minecraft server in the cloud ready so that you can deploy it on the go.

Description: I run a minecraft server locally for my friends. Generally, I keep it online when I'm home. However, I don't take my laptop with me so I power it down when I'm out and about. Hence, the server goes offline. It's inconvenient for them. This is the perfect use case for AWS. You don't want to commit to monthly subscriptions for a server that may be used for less than 15 hours/month. I'm not crunching numbers because this will be using the free tier (not ideal for a minecraft sever, but hey at least it's a free server). If this is something you want to run all the time and don't understand how to open your network you may want to consider a hosting service like realm.

Linux: Coming Soon


Windows: After Linux
